# F1 Formula Data Pipeline Using Azure Cloud Platform
In this project, I designed a data pipeline for performing ETL on F1 Formula racing dataset using Azure Cloud Platform.

The dataset is extracted from Ergast API, containing F1 Formula racing data from 1950 onwards. The following ER Diagram shows the design of the database and how the components interact with each other.
